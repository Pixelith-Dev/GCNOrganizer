Multi-Disc is a little bit trickier to pull off since most discs have the same title and ID, which is why you have to select them in a proper order. Even simply renaming them 1,2,3, and so on first will ensure the program properly grabs the data, makes the fodlers, and renames them to the proper disc names.
